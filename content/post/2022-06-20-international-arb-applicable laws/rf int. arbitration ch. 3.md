## Ch. 3 Applicable laws

#### A complex interaction of laws



(1) the law governing the arbitration agreement and the performance of that
agreement;
(2) the law governing the existence and proceedings of the arbitral tribunal (the
lex arbitri);
(3) the law, or the relevant legal rules, governing the substantive issues in dispute
(generally described as the ‘applicable law’, the ‘governing law’, ‘the proper
law of the contract’, or ‘the substantive law’);
(4) other applicable rules and non-binding guidelines and recommendations;3
and
(5) the law governing recognition and enforcement of the award (which may, in
practice, prove to be not one law, but two or more, if recognition and enforcement is sought in more than one country in which the losing party has, or is
thought to have, assets).4



### Law Governing the Agreement to Arbitrate

It might be assumed that this is the same law as that which the parties chose to
govern the substantive issues in dispute—but this is not necessarily a safe assumption.
An ‘applicable law clause’ will usually refer only to the ‘substantive issues in
dispute’. It will not usually refer in terms to disputes that might arise in relation
to the arbitration agreement itself. It would therefore be sensible, in drafting an
arbitration agreement, also to make clear what law is to apply to that agreement.



If no such express designation has been made and it becomes necessary to determine
the law applicable to the agreement to arbitrate, what are the choices?5 There
are other possibilities, but the principal choice—in the absence of any express or
implied choice by the parties—lies between the law of the seat of the arbitration
and the law that governs the contract as a whole.

5 For an in-depth discussion of this issue, see Lew, ‘The law applicable to the form and substance
of the arbitration clause’ (1999) 9 ICCA Congress Series 114.

#### Law of the contract 
6 See Sulamérica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA and ors v Enesa Engenharia SA and ors [2012] EWCA
Civ 638, at [11], in which the English Court of Appeal observed:
It has long been recognised that in principle the proper law of an arbitration agreement which itself
forms part of a substantive contract may differ from that of the contract as a whole, but it is probably
fair to start from the assumption that, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, the parties
intended the whole of their relationship to be governed by the same system of law.

This supports the view that the arbitration clause is generally governed by the same
law as the rest of the contract. However, the reference here to the ‘autonomy’ of
the arbitration clause points towards the problem that may arise. An arbitration
clause is taken to be autonomous and to be separable from other clauses in the
agreement.9 If necessary, it may stand alone. In this respect, it is comparable to a
submission agreement. It is this separability of an arbitration clause that opens the
way for the possibility that it may be governed by a different law from that which
governs the main agreement.

The New York Convention points towards this conclusion.10 In the provisions
relating to enforcement, the Convention stipulates that the agreement under
which the award is made must be valid ‘under the law to which the parties have
subjected it’, or, failing any indication thereon, ‘under the law of the country
where the award was made’ (which will be the law of the seat of the arbitration).


#### Law of the seat of the arbitration

LCIA Article 16(4) that:
The law applicable to the Arbitration Agreement and the arbitration shall be the
law applicable at the seat of the arbitration, unless and to the extent that the parties
have agreed in writing on the application of other laws or rules of law and such
agreement is not prohibited by the law applicable at the arbitral seat.

**Sulamérica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA and ors v Enesa Engenharia SA and ors**

The English Court of Appeal held that the law of the arbitration agreement
was to be determined by application of the three-stage enquiry established at
common law.
(1) If the parties made an express choice of law to govern the arbitration agreement,
that choice would be effective, regardless of the law applicable to the
contract as a whole.
(2) Where the parties failed expressly to specify the law of the arbitration agreement,
it was necessary to consider whether the parties had made an implied
choice of law.
(3) Where it was not possible to establish the law of the arbitration agreement
by implication, it was necessary to consider what would be the law with the
‘closest and most real connection’ with the arbitration agreement.

#### Parties’ common intention—a French ‘third way’

The French courts, however, have adopted a
different method whereby the existence and scope of the arbitration agreement is
determined exclusively by reference to the parties’ discernible common intentions.

Municipalité de Khoms El Mergeb c/Sté Dalico, Cass. Civ. 1ere, 20 December 1993, [1994] Rev
Arb 116

The French Supreme
Court thus stopped short of a complete delocalisation of the arbitration agreement,
by subjecting it to the mandatory provisions of French law.30

[Under French law,] arbitration agreements derive their existence, validity and
effect from supra-national law, without it being necessary to refer to any national
law. If so, that would not avoid the need to have regard to French law ‘as the law
of the country where the award was made’ under Article V(1)(a) of the Convention
and s. 103(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. The Cour de Cassation is, however, a national
court, giving a French legal view of international arbitration; and Dallah and the
Government agree that the true analysis is that French law recognises transnational
principles as potentially applicable to determine the existence, validity and
effectiveness of an international arbitration agreement, such principles being part
of French law.33

Pakistan—Ministère des Affaires Religieuses v Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding Co., Case No.
09/28533, 17 February 2011


#### Combining several approaches—a Swiss model

Section 178(2) of the Swiss Federal Statute of Private International Law (Swiss
PIL) provides:
As regards its substance, the arbitration agreement shall be valid if it conforms
either to the law chosen by the parties, or to the law governing the subject-matter
of the dispute, in particular the law governing the main contract, or if it conforms
to Swiss law.
This formulation allows Swiss courts maximum opportunity to uphold the validity
of the arbitration agreement.

### Law Governing the Arbitration

Article 18(1) of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules, for instance, states: ‘If the parties have
not previously agreed on the place of arbitration, the place of arbitration shall be
determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case.’

#### What is the lex arbitri?

What then is the law governing the arbitration? It is, as the present authors trenchantly
explain,[39] a body of rules which sets a standard external to the arbitration
agreement, and the wishes of the parties, for the conduct of the arbitration. The
law governing the arbitration comprises the rules governing interim measures (eg
Court orders for the preservation or storage of goods), the rules empowering the
exercise by the Court of supportive measures to assist an arbitration which has run
into difficulties (eg filling a vacancy in the composition of the arbitral tribunal
if there is no other mechanism) and the rules providing for the exercise by the
Court of its supervisory jurisdiction over arbitrations (eg removing an arbitrator
for misconduct).40

#### The content of the lex arbitri

Each state will decide for itself what laws it wishes to lay down to govern the conduct
of arbitrations within its own territory

With this qualification, the lex arbitri is likely to extend to:
• the definition and form of an agreement to arbitrate;
• whether a dispute is capable of being referred to arbitration (that is, whether it is
‘arbitrable’ under the lex arbitri);
• the constitution of the arbitral tribunal and any grounds for challenge of that
tribunal;
• the entitlement of the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction;
• equal treatment of the parties;
• freedom to agree upon detailed rules of procedure;
• interim measures of protection;
• statements of claim and defence;
• hearings;
• default proceedings;
• court assistance, if required;
• the powers of the arbitrators, including any powers to decide as amiables
compositeurs;
• the form and validity of the arbitration award; and
• the finality of the award, including any right to challenge it in the courts of the
place of arbitration.

#### Procedural rules and the lex arbitri

The preceding discussion about the content of the lex arbitri indicates that most,
if not all, national laws governing arbitration deal with general propositions, such as the need to treat each party equally, rather than with detailed rules of procedure,
such as the time for exchange of witness statements or the submission of
pre-hearing briefs.

The rules of the arbitral institutions,
such as the ICC and the LCIA, provide an overall framework within which to
operate, as do the UNCITRAL Rules. However, it is important to note that even
these rules will need to be supplemented by more detailed provisions by the parties
or the arbitral tribunal, as discussed in Chapter 6.


#### Seat theory

Article 2 of the 1923 Geneva Protocol states:
‘The arbitral
procedure, including the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, shall be governed by
the will of the parties and by the law of the country in whose territory the arbitration
takes place.’50

in a passage approved by the Court of Appeal in Naviera
Amazonia Peruana SA v Compania Internacional de Seguros del Peru [1988] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 116 at 121, it may often be convenient to hold meetings or even hearings in
other countries. This does not mean that the ‘seat’ of the arbitration changes with
each change of country. The legal place of the arbitration remains the same even
if the physical place changes from time to time, unless of course the parties agree
to change it.61

#### Delocalisation 

The second development is to detach an international arbitration from control
by the law of the place in which it is held. This is the so-called delocalisation theory,
the idea being that instead of a dual system of control, first by the lex arbitri and
then by the courts of the place of enforcement of the award, there should be only
one point of control: that of the place of enforcement

[A] n international arbitral award, which does not belong to any state legal system, is
an international decision of justice and its validity must be examined according
to the applicable rules of the country where its recognition and enforcement are
sought.89



The first argument is, in effect, that an international arbitration is self-regulating
and that this is, or should be, sufficient.



The second argument in support of the delocalisation theory is that any control of
the process of international arbitration should come only at the place of enforcement
of the award



## Law Applicable to the Substance

However, where the contract is in
respect of an international transaction, the position is more complicated: there may
then be two, or more, different national systems of law capable of qualifying as the
substantive law of the contract, and—although it is important not to exaggerate
the possibilities—these different national systems may contain contradictory rules
of law on the particular point or points in issue.



#### Autonomy of the parties

It is generally recognised that parties to an international commercial agreement
are free to choose for themselves the law (or the legal rules) applicable to that
agreement.112

Both international conventions and the model rules on international arbitration
confirm that the parties are free to choose for themselves the law applicable to
their contract

Rome I Regulation, Art. 3, provides that a choice of law, or a variation of a choice, can be made
at any time after the conclusion of the contract by agreement between the parties.



The answer is that there may be limited restrictions on the rule, designed to ensure
that the choice of law is bona fide and is not contrary to public policy. Thus the
Rome I Regulation, for example, does not allow the choice of a foreign law to
override the mandatory rules of law of a country towards which all of the factual
elements of the contract point



Parties to an international commercial agreement should make full and proper use
of this freedom, inserting a ‘choice of law’ clause into their contract.



The choices that may be
available to the parties include:
• national law;
• public international law (including the general principles of law);
• concurrent laws (and combined laws—the tronc commun doctrine);
• transnational law (including international development law, the lex mercatoria,
codified terms and practices, and trade usages); and
• equity and good conscience



##### Mandatory law

Mandatory rules have been defined as
those that ‘cannot be derogated from by way of Contract’,138 and may feature in the
determination of a contractual dispute in addition to the governing law selected
by the parties.

However, perhaps the most frequently encountered instance of the application of mandatory law is competition, or antitrust, law



#### Public international law and general principles of law

There are many sources of public international law, including international
conventions and international custom, but probably the most relevant, as far as
non-state parties are concerned, are ‘the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations’.149 These have been defined as ‘the general principles of municipal
jurisprudence, in particular of private law, in so far as they are applicable to
relations of States’.150

150 Jennings and Watts (eds) Oppenheim’s International Law, Vol. I (9th edn, Oxford University
Press, 1992), p. 29, cited



##### Concurrent laws, combined laws, and the tronc commun **doctrine**

one of the main anxieties among commercial organisations engaged in trading
or other business relationships with a sovereign state is that, after the bargain has
been struck and the contract has been signed, the state may change its own law to the
disadvantage of the private party.



In this way, international law would be brought into play to set a
minimum standard, which the arbitral tribunal would be empowered to uphold
in its award

Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd v Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (1979) 53 ILR 297; Libyan
American Oil Co. (Liamco) v Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (1981) 20 ILM 1, (1981) VI
YBCA 89.



#### Transnational law (including the lex mercatoria,the UNIDROIT Principles, trade usages, and Shari’ah)
##### Lex mercatoria

One of the most important developments in the field of transnational law was
that of the lex mercatoria. This draws on the sources of law that have already been
mentioned, including public international law generally and the general principles
of law specifically



##### UNIDROIT 

Reference has already been made to the UNIDROIT Principles of International
Commercial Contracts.215 They are, in nature, a restatement of the general principles
of contract law. The principles are comprehensive,216 covering not only the interpretation and performance of contractual obligations, but also the conduct of
negotiations leading to the formation of a contract





### Conflict Rules and the Search for the Applicable Law



#### Implied or tacit choice

In such an event, the court—or the arbitral tribunal—will generally decide that
the contract is to be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely
connected. It will be presumed that this is the country that is the place of business
or residence of the party that is to effect the performance characteristic of the
contract



#### Choice of forum as choice of law

If the parties make no
express choice of law, but agree that any disputes between them shall be litigated in
a particular country, it is generally assumed that they intend the law of that country
to apply to the substance of their disputes.



#### Conflict rules 

These conflict rules usually serve to indicate what law is to be
chosen as the law applicable to a contract.
