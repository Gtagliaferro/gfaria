# Turing's vision 

In 1936, when he was just twenty-four years old, Alan Turing wrote a remarkable paper in which he outlined the theory of computation,  laying out the ideas that underlie all modern computers. This  groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer  science. In Turing’s Vision, Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turing’s most important  contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turing’s theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a  straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the  non-specialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, “The sheer simplicity of the  theory’s foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical  beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory.”  Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the  surprising conclusions. He also views Turing’s theory in the context of  mathematical history, other views of computation (including those of  Alonzo Church), Turing’s later work, and the birth of the modern  computer.

In the paper, “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking  it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical  machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that  there were problems that were beyond any computer's ability to solve; in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove  was undecidable. To explain Turing’s ideas, Bernhardt examines three  well-known decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability;  investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines;  explains universal machines; and proves that certain problems are  undecidable, including Turing’s problem concerning computable numbers.
