# The problem of the true meaning of a text

What the Bible meant? What a poem tried to convey? What actions did a statute constrain? Humans are constantly making these questions of interpretation and trying to find a true meaning of a text when navigating reality, but we never managed to find a criteria that would lead us to the real and definite meaning of a text. As an attempt to solve this problem, the field of hermeneutics was born, firstly, as a way to interpret and discover the meaning of the words of God, as the process of *exegesis* conducted by the theologians. Further, in the eighteenth century,the question became a matter of theoretical study, being developed by characters like Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm Dilthey and, more recently, by Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer. The first two thought that hermeneutics was for the humanities what mathematics was for the natural sciences, and the last two considered it to be the key of human experience. 



## A problem of methodology

When hermeneutics started to be a theoretical discipline in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it had witnessed the Industrial and Scientific Revolution, which used the method of induction and the tools of mathematics extensively as the grounds to their propositions. Some, attempted to replicate the same system into the humanities, like John Stuart Mill that proposed the application of the inductive method to subjects outside the natural sciences, such as ethics, which could have been calculated.

Due to that intellectual environment, Schleiermacher and Dilthey focused on making hermeneutics as the basis of the human sciences, the *Geisteswissenschaften*. Hermeneutics was a method to correctly interpret a text and find its true meaning. 

For Schleiermacher, the ideal system of interpretation would access the thoughts of the author when he composed the text. The is composed of two elements, the grammatical  and the psychological. The grammatical interpretation is the consideration of the language of the text, its outer expression and the psychological is the consideration of the thoughts of the author and his intentions. If an interpretation valued correctly both elements then it would be successfull. 

For Dilthey

## A problem of reality 

The twentieth century philosophy contends with this idea of hermeneutics being simply a matter of method, for them, mainly Heidegger and Gadamer, hermeneutics was way of experiencing the truth within reality. Martin Heidegger portrays the question of interpretation in the perspective of ontology, of the meaning of human existence  and Gadamer expands his ideas developing his *philosophical hermeneutics*.



### Martin Heidegger's perspective 

Martin Heidegger's ideas are focused in the question of being (*Dasein*), and for him this question starts with a self-interpretation about what the self actually is. That's why hermeneutics is concerned with the experience of reality itself, not merely limited by the meaning of texts. 



### Gadamer's contribution 

For the construction of his theory, Gadamer draws from the ideas of Heidegger and from the greeks,  from Plato, the importance of the dialogue for understanding, and from Aristotle, the concept of *phroenesis*, e.g. practical knowledge, good sense. *Phroenesis* plays a role on interpretation, because there's no set of rational rules that guide the hermeneutical process. 

#### Prejudice 

The concept of prejudice is essential for the comprehension of the phenomenon of interpretation. For Heidegger and Gadamer, as a result of the *being in the world*, every new knowledge is confronted with a 'fore-structure' of pre conceived knowledge, the prejudice. So the acquirement of knew knowledge must be a result of the dialogue between your pre-judgments and the new knowledge. Here, the Plato's dialogues influence become apparent, because knowledge is produced when prejudice questions and exposes its problems of the object and, after that, the object questions the prejudice.  		



## "Truth and method" book summary



## The Humanities 


Gadamer contends with the idea that the natural sciences and the humanities share the same method of induction to arrive at the truth. 

J. S. Mill was wrong in transposing the inductive method the human sciences, exemplified by his moral calculus, because of the lack of data that it has. For that reason, there's a difficulty in making universal propositions in the human sciences, there are variables that affect the results that are not apprehensible to us. 

Why physics can state propositions that are solid as rock and meteorology cannot? Because the variables that influence the chain of cause and effect can be reduced to its minimum in physics and in meteorology there are more variables involved and that are harder to calculate. Imagine then the task of history, sociology and law whom need to consider variables like human freedom.

For him, both Schleiermacher and Dilthey didn't grasp the nature of hermeneutics. They understood hermeneutics to be simply a correct method of interpretation that would provide the truth of the text. Besides that they focus too much on the intention of the author to provide the meaning of the text. 





### Basic elements 

Trying to comprehend the mode of operation of the humanities, Gadamer inquires about four concepts, **Bildung (culture), *sensus communis*, judgement and taste**.



### Bildung 

Bildung refers to the German tradition of self-cultivation, wherein philosophy and education are linked in a manner that refers to a process of both personal and cultural maturation.

In Hegel's theory, *bildung* is the movement from the particular to the universal, from the natural to the spiritual, from the self to the other. It is to absorb someone else's way of leaving, its culture. To achieve that, he recommended the reading of the classics, whom where so distant and different that would invoke the sentiment of the general, of the other.

### *Sensus communis*

*Sensus communis* is the knowledge derived from the experience of the community. It doesn't intend to be the truth but the plausible. It has a rhetorical component and it is related to the concept *phronesis* present in Aristotle's writings, the practical knowledge.  

### Judgment 

Judgment is the capability of subsume the universal to the particular. 

When we recognize an application of a general rule to a particular case there were no logical principle that oriented that. It was a sentiment that did that, even in the application of logical rules, the activity of reason is not exclusive. 

### Taste 

Taste is what a community rejects or accepts. It is a social phenomenon that forms a norm, which is construed from a case to case basis.


Moral rules and customs abide by the norms of taste and require a special judgment for its application because it does not follow universal rules. 

It is important to point  out that Kant, in his "Critique of pure reason", made invalid every knowledge from the humanities that could not be converted to an universal rule, but, in his "Critique of judgement", he made possible for the humanities to base its knowledge in the concept of taste.
