# Gadamer - "Truth and method"

Gadamer develops the *philosophical hermeneutics* that started with Heidegger in his "Being and time". He defends that hermeneutics is not restricted to a matter of interpretation, but it is an experience of truth. Furthermore, it is the basis of the *human sciences*. 

## The Humanities 


Gadamer contends the idea that the natural sciences and the humanities share the same method of induction to arrive at the truth. 



J. S. Mill was wrong in transposing the inductive method the human sciences, exemplified by his moral calculus, because of the lack of data that it has. For that reason, there's a difficulty in making universal propositions in the human sciences, there are variables that affect the results that are not apprehensible to us. 



Why physics can state propositions that are solid as rock and meteorology cannot? Because the variables that influence the chain of cause and effect can be reduced to its minimum in physics and in meteorology there are more variables involved and that are harder to calculate. Imagine then the task of history, sociology and law whom need to consider variables like human freedom.



For him, both Schleiermacher and Dilthey didn't grasp the nature of hermeneutics. They understood hermeneutics to be simply a correct method of interpretation that would provide the truth of the text. Besides that they focus too much on the intention of the author to provide the meaning of the text. 



Hermeneutics is more than [What is hermeneutics for Gadamer]



### Basic elements 

Trying to comprehend the mode of operation of the humanities, Gadamer inquires about four concepts, **Bildung (culture), *sensus communis*, judgement and taste**.



### Bildung 

Bildung is a process of cultivation and formation by the means of culture.



In Hegel's theory, *bildung* is the movement from the particular to the universal, from the natural to the spiritual, from the self to the other. It is to absorb someone else's way of leaving, its culture. To achieve that, he recommended the reading of the classics, whom where so distant and different that would invoke the sentiment of the general, of the other.



### *Sensus communis*

*Sensus communis* is the knowledge derived from the experience of the community. It doesn't intend to be the truth but the plausible. It has a rhetorical component and it is related to the concept *phronesis* present in Aristotle's writings, the practical knowledge. 

 

### Judgment 

Judgment is the capability of subsume the universal to the particular. 



When we recognize an application of a general rule to a particular case there were no logical principle that oriented that. It was a sentiment that did that, even in the application of logical rules, the activity of reason is not exclusive. 



### Taste 

Taste is what a community rejects or accepts. It is a social phenomenon that forms a norm, which is construed from a case to case basis.



Moral rules and customs abide by the norms of taste and require a special judgment for its application because it does not follow universal rules. 



It is important to point  out that Kant, in his "Critique of pure reason", made invalid every knowledge from the humanities that could not be converted to an universal rule, but, in his "Critique of judgement", he made possible for the humanities to base its knowledge in the concept of taste.
